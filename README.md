## First:
Fork and Clone LTUC Repo https://github.com/LTUC/301-entrance-exam-retake

### Convert the attached wireframe to html, css and js code. 
You will be building a simple webpage "Hunger Restaurant" which contains so many choices of meals to let the user picks his favorite food.
​
As a user, I would like to order my food from the provided menu so I can manage my order.
- Create a form to add the order type as (select) and the quantity to the local storage.
​
As a user, I would like to view my orders that I already added so that I can quickly view my order List in a table.

- Whenever you add an order using the form, you should use the local storage to get all the orders from it and render them to a table using DOM as shown at the wireframe. Notice that the table should contain header, body and footer.
​
​
#### Do this work on a branch called 'exam-solution'.
​
1. Create an HTML file and convert the wireframe into HTML structure.
2. Create a CSS file to apply the style.
- The used font is "Roboto" -> google font.
- The used color is for the header is "#f13b04e3" and for the borders "#ddd".
3. Create a js file to handle the functionality.
- Handle adding the orders to the table and local storage.
- Handle getting the orders from the local storage and display them.
- Handle calculating the total number of orders.

4. merge your branch to master.
​
#### P.S.: you MUST use constructor and local storage in order to solve this question PLUS when you refresh the page, all the data should be persistent.
